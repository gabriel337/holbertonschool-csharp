# 0x09. C# - Linear Algebra

# Background Context
This project is an introduction to linear algebra and its concepts. Linear algebra is essential to computer graphics and will give you a better understanding of what’s going on under the hood of game and graphics engines.

# Resources
### Read or watch:

* Essence of Linear Algebra Playlist
* Immersive Math (Read chapters 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7)
* The True Power of the Matrix (Transformations in Graphics) - Computerphile
* Math Class (System.Math)
* Khan Academy - Linear Algebra
* Linear Algebra in 4 Pages
* GeoGebra 3D Graphing Calculator (Useful for visualizing 3D vectors)

# Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

## General
* What is linear algebra
* What is a radian
* What is a vector
* What is a vector space
* What is a scalar
* What is a linear transformation
* What is a transformation matrix
* What is transposing
* What is linear independence and linear dependence
* What is a dot product and how to calculate it
* What is a cross product and how to calculate it
* What is a standard basis
* What is a matrix
* What is the identity matrix
* What is the zero matrix
* What is a determinant and how to calculate it
* What is the inverse of a matrix and how to calculate it

# Requirements
## .txt Answers
* All your files should end with a new line
* If the answer ends in a decimal, round it to the nearest hundredth
* Vectors and matrices should be formatted with parentheses and commas as shown below:
### Vector:

(0, 0.03)
### Matrix:

(1, 0, -7.64)
(-9.41, -0.23, 7)
# C# Projects
* Allowed editors: Visual Studio Code
* All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using dotnet
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
* All default C# files named Program.cs should be renamed to the name given in each task
* Each C# task requires its own folder and .csproj file. Push all task folders to your GitHub and ensure the task names on the folders are correct
* You do not need to push your obj/ or bin/ folders
* In the following tasks, there are no main files. For each C# task, you can use the variables in the related task prior to it to create your own main files for testing
* All your public classes and their members should have XML documentation tags
* All your private classes and members should be documented but without XML documentation tags
* You are not allowed to use the Vector or Matrix classes in this project
* You can use the Math class in this project
* If the task’s return value can end in a decimal, round it to the nearest hundredth
# More Info
This project uses radians instead of degrees
